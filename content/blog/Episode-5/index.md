Rabbi Dan Ain and Ben Chinn discuss the 2001 Steven Spielberg film, A.I. Artificial Intelligence. Can a robot love? Is there any reason why we should love it back? What's the difference between a dog, an alien, an android and a toy cowboy? Was Stanley Kubrick brought down by a secretive globalist cabal? All this and more in this episode of the Jewish Frame.
